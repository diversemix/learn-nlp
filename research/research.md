# Research

A brief summary of the research and the journey I have done to investigate more into the area of the world of semantics, the web and publication.

First started off locally - to see if anything has been done in Cambridge. This paper was an interesting read as it looks around 10 years old. It was also done with the RSC and Nature Publishing Group

- (PDF) [Extracting the Science from Scientific Publications](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~aac10/escience/public.pdf) published by [Ann Copestake](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~aac10) et al. http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.97.6002 -

TechMiner is a more recent article, presented a couple of years ago at the annual EKAW conference (http://ekaw.org/). The TechMiner approach was evaluated by a group of 8 Semantic Web experts (PhD students, postdocs, and research fellows) from The Open University and Oxford University.

The interesting thing for me in the above document is the use of RDF repositories, that are becoming standard in this area:
- http://ontoware.org/swrc/ (broken)
- http://bibliontology.com (2009)
- https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/ (2013)
- http://www.aktors.org/publications/ontology (broken)
- https://www.force11.org/software-citation-principles

The semantic web community contributed to this process by creating a number of scholarly repositories in RDF, such as Semantic Dog Food[1], RKBExplorer [2], Bio2RDF [3], and others....

... Really **need** to understand about RDF vs XML ...

Looking into this area links to projects such as the http://opencitations.net/ (via https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9fiUc6G30k) and their use of SPQRQL - see endpoint here: http://opencitations.net/sparql

Another Framework that is used is the "Dr. Inventor Text Mining Framework" (2016)

Part of my interest into this led me to contact Horacio Saggion (via ResearchGate), he was good enough to send me the full-text article.

It uses PDFX as the first stage of converting the PDF to XML

:bulb: What is apparent is that there seems to be no framework that is actively maintained for doing this sort of work.
