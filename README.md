# learn-nlp

Notes and examples from learning Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## Aim

Learn about NLP, primarily for the purpose of semantic extraction.

- [Pluralsight Course on NLTK](nltk/swetha-kolalapudi.md)

## Other (interesting tangents)

In learning NLP and contemplating the potential uses for elifesciences.org, the following areas were also studied:

1) Lecture 1 of the Standford Course: *NLP with Deep Learning* ( [Notes here](cs224/cs224-lecture1.md) to help my grasp the "big picture")

2) Investigation into other potential solutions, applications and publications in the field. This investigation can be followed [on this page](research/research.md)

## Outstanding Questions

### Semantic Extraction

- Could the use of morpholical analysis on a manuscript text be a useful feature to be used in semantic extraction?
- Are we at the limit of ML for semantic extraction? (Chart shows that typically ML asymptotically reaches 90% success)
