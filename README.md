## Other (interesting tangents)

In learning NLP and contemplating the potential uses for elifesciences.org, the following areas were also studied:

1) Lecture 1 of the Standford Course: *NLP with Deep Learning* ( [Notes here](cs224/cs224-lecture1.md) to help my grasp the "big picture")

2) Investigation into other potential solutions, applications and  publications in the field. This investigation can be followed [on this page](research/research.md)
